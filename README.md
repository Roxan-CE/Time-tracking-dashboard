## My process



### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [JQuery](https://jquery.com/) - JS library
- [Bootstrap v5](https://getbootstrap.com/) - CSS Framework
- [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) - CSS Extension

### What I learned

I learned how to use SASS in this project. I also got to use it alongside Bootstrap, though I mainly used bootstrap for the containers.

This was also a practice for using JQuery. I'm quite happy with the functions I created on this project. I managed to make them reusable to avoid a lot of unnecessary code repetitions. I also did a little extra function to this app. The challenge only had us update the timeframe for all modules at once, but i added a little drop down menu to be able to change the timeframe for each module individually.

### Continued development

In the future, I would like to play around with the concept of draggable and sortable divs using JQuery or React.
